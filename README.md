Vanilla javaScript Pac-Man Game with HTML and CSS that moves one of the ghosts using very simple 'SMART MOVE' logic, which decides the shortest route from A to B (from the ghost to Pac Man - logic has a LTR, TTB bias).

In this game Pac-Man moves around the grid while avoiding walls. The constructor method is used for all four ghosts to apply unque characterisitcs to each one, including at what speed they move at.
